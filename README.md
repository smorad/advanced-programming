====================

Programs written in C++11 for CMPS109 (Advanced Programming). Mostly dealing with AI and Graph ADTs.

cs109hw2
--------
Creation of a graph ADT and implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

cs109hw3
--------
Reusing our graph ADT to implement Kruskal's algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree.

cs109hw4
--------
Reusing our graph ADT to implement the game Hex with a very basic AI.

cs109hw5
--------
Implementing humanly unbeatable AI for the game Hex. I chose to use a Monte Carlo approach. Others also tried using a smart AlphaBeta algorithm.

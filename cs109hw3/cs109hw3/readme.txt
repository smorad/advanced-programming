I did not learn that much new stuff during the build of this program because I had already implemented it before. I learned to integrate it into the already built program which was kind of interesting. I also got better at organizing my code. Cleaning my old code was also useful and helped see how much I have grown as a coder. I believe the hardest part was the color tests. Over all I believe it was another good practice to understand C++ more.
